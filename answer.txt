##Q1

(a)
α is  95.9662 
τ is  -9.1057 
β is  1.5149

(b)
estimated ATE (ˆτ ) is −9.11 which is significant with p < 0.001; 

(c)
ate is assumed to be unconfoundedness. This means there should be no unmeasured confounding variables (other than X) 
that affect both treatment assignment (W) and the engagement score (Y).
only if W and Y is random or unrelated to those other factors, we can trust the results.
